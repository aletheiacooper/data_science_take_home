# Fire Department Incident Time Analysis

## Pre-run environment set up
### Tested systems
This code has been tested with python 3.7 on Linux, specifically Amazon Linux 2. It should run without issue on any system with python 3.7 and higher (and possibly earlier versions of python) as long as the pipenv package can be installed with pip.

* Install a version of python 3, using 3.7 or higher for guaranteed compatibility
